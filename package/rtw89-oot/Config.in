	  Out-of-tree rtw89 driver from lwfinger/rtw89.

	  This provides RTL8852BE WiFi support that is missing from
	  the Rockchip BSP kernel. The BSP kernel 6.1 has incomplete
	  stubs for 8852B support - this package provides the complete
	  driver backported from mainline Linux.

	  Supported chipsets:
	  - RTL8851BE
	  - RTL8852AE
	  - RTL8852BE (Rock 5T WiFi chip)
	  - RTL8852CE
	  - RTL8922AE
